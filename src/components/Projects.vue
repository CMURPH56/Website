      <p class="project-description">
        This quiz application is made with Vue.js and 
        Firebase. Matches you to a classic horror 
        villian based off of your answers to  a
        series of questions. <a href="http://www.camshorrorquiz.com/">

      <h2> OBII Cloud Connect </h2>
      <p class="project-description">
        This application was created through <a href = "https://www.chipy.org/"> CHIPYS</a>
        mentorship program. I volunteered to help build a react application that
        would read data from firebase, which was populated by a Raspberry Pi, plugged into
        the obdii port of the car.
